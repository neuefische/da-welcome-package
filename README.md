# Welcome to Data Analytics!

We are very happy to have you here. To help you get started and to bridge the time until the course starts, we have created this repository for you. Have fun!

## The introductory guide to the Data Analytics bootcamp

An interactive presentation will give you a first impression of what to expect over the next weeks. It will take you about one to three hours, depending on how much time you'll spend with the slides and if you will watch all the video material embedded. If a video doesn't suit you right now, feel free to skip it!

### How to use the introductory guide presentation

The introductory guide is provided as a HTML file. You can use this link [https://neuefische.github.io/da-welcome-package/](https://neuefische.github.io/da-welcome-package/) to start directly with the presentation. 

Now you can navigate through the slides via the navigation control on the bottom - you may need to scroll down a little bit - and by clicking on the Go-to-slide-buttons on the slides. There is also a Fullscreen option in the bottom right corner.

__Have fun!__

### Before you start
In order to have a common starting point it is important that you know how to use your Macbook and Zoom. We also ask you to have some basic knowledge of python. You do not need to install anything on your computer in order to work with the material, all material is browser based and we will be using [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/).
In this repository we will cover the general concepts that you should be familiar with before the start of the bootcamp.

If you are not familiar with Google Colab, please start with [Intro to Colab notebook](Intro_to_Colab.ipynb) which shows you how to work with Colab.

We are covering two aspects: python programming. In case you are not familiar with the following concepts please following the codealongs and reading material.

Do not forget, programming is a skill that gets better with practice, if this is your first time with python, you might need repetition. And we will practice this!
